Design Inspiration from [Md. Shamsul Alam
](https://dribbble.com/shots/20889124-CoffeeBean-Coffee-shop-website) âœ¨

I created the 3D models and did the texturing to bring the coffee beans to life. The development was also done by me, using the stack technology above to create an interactive and engaging experience. ðŸ˜‰
